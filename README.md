This project consists of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model consisting of 2 input nodes, 4 hidden LSTM layers, and a single output node to predicted the trend that the market is heading into and plots a graph of the same.

The application is built on a python library called Tkinter. You can inpyt the stock ticker that you need a prediction for and it will output the predicted stocks for the next 7 days.
